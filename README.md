# harvest-overtime

This is still WIP!

## What?

This is an attempt to use Harvest API to calculate the overtime for Comsysto employees. The calculation is based on 40 hrs week, so it won't show correct results for people working halftime (or less than 40 hrs / week). This will be fixed soon.

## Why?

We like both ELM and Harvest ;-)

## Where?

Want to see it in action? Np, go [here](https://comsysto.github.io/harvest-overtime). But of course it makes sense only if you are a comsysto employee.

## I'm not a comsysto employee. Can I still use it?

Sorry to hear that. You still have 2 options:

1. Apply [here](https://comsysto.com/karriere/jobs) and be happy

2. Roll your own with our [Harvest API for Elm](https://github.com/comsysto/harvest-api)
